  <p class="body">Stephen Brewster is a Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. He got his PhD in auditory interfaces at the University of York. He  leads the Multimodal Interaction Group in Glasgow, which is very active and has a very strong international reputation. His research focuses on multimodal HCI, or using multiple sensory modalities and control mechanisms (particularly audio, haptics and gesture) to create a rich, natural interaction between human and computer. His work has a strong experimental focus, applying perceptual research to practical situations. A long term focus has been on mobile interaction and how we can design better user interfaces for users who are on the move. Other areas of interest include accessibility, wearable devices and in-car interaction. According to Google Scholar, he has 375 publications. He is a member of the SIGCHI Academy.</p>
